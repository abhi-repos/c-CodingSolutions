The algorithm looks deceivingly simple, yet it is surprisingly very tough to implement, even with a good set of data structures in hand. A good structure to use for this algorithm is three priority queues:

    For the current direction with entries past the current point,
    For the opposite direction, and
    for the current direction prior to the current point.

Your implementation would first decide the direction, then pick a queue into which to place the requested pair of {from, to} values.
